Events:

Features:
- Implement Websockets, send events, and receive an event whenever game state updates
- Update the UI code appropriately

Tech Debt:
- In http_game_service.go, update serialization to use JSON tags on the game struct.
- Refactor service.go, create a different function for each event, instead of one giant switch statement.
- In logging package, add warn and error log messages
- In logging package, add logger names

Stretch Goals:
- Implement game state using event-sourcing instead of transactional updates
- Log all events to a file, and replay. To get a replay of a previous game.
